## What I Want to Build

_[Speak or type everything that comes to mind about what you want to build]_

I want to build a feature that when users search for a podcast and they click on that podcast instead of paginating through many pages I want them to able to search for a specific podcast so for example, a user may type ADHD and podcasts relating to ADHD for that podcast should show up so for example user types for a podcast they click on that podcast and if they don't want to go through pagination I still want to pagination to be there but if a user doesn't want to go through pagination, they can type in the search bar for an episode so they can type keywords or a keyword and relevant episodes should show up for that keyword or that desired episode

 also when a user clicks on a podcast and they type for a podcast and nothing shows up there should be a button that says back with the user can go back to the podcast instead of searching again because if they search then the search count will go up and that search can't is used up so what uses to be able to go back to the podcast instead of going to able to search again?

## User Scenarios

_[Describe how users will interact with this feature]_

so A user will go to New Summary and search for a podcast, and then when they click ona podcast, they go to the episodes page where all the episodes are shown for that clicked podcast. Then users should be able to search for an episode in the search bar. A user can type certain keywords or the episode name, and relevant episodes should show up. If there are no matches, the user should be able to go back by clicking on the back button, then the user is taken back to the page of the podcasts. 
so a users searches for a podcast, clickes on it, then they can search for episode either through pagination or by typeing. if the user want to go back to the page where all the podcasts are shown, they can do go by clicking on the back button, then they are taken to the page where all the podcasts are shown for the initial search.

## Edge Cases & Considerations

_[What edge cases are you thinking about?]_
I dont want the search count to increment when the user seaches for an episode and i dont want the seach count to increment when they go back to the main page where all the podcasts are.
So, when a user is searching for an episode, when they type for example 'adhd' episode for that clicked podcast, only matching episodes for that clicked podcast should show up, not other podcasts. Also, the search count should not go up when searching for episodes.

## Additional Thoughts

_[Anything else relevant - technical considerations, design ideas, etc.]_

The keywords when searching for an episode can be name, person, topic, etc, and then relevant episodes for that clicked podcast should show up. Episodes for other podcasts should not show up when a user is searching for an episode.
