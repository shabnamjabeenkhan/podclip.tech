# Podclip: High-Level Idea & MVP

## The Idea
Podclip is a podcast app that enhances audio content with AI-driven features. Users can listen to full podcast episodes and instantly get AI-generated written summaries and key takeaways. The app also offers an AI chat assistant for episode-specific questions and brainstorming. Notion integration allows users to export insights for productivity. The product is designed for anyone who wants to get more value from podcastsâ€”especially knowledge workers, students, and time-constrained listeners.

## Business Model
Podclip is a paid product with two plans:
- **Monthly Subscription**: Recurring access to all features (except lifetime-only perks)
- **Lifetime Access**: One-time payment for permanent access to all features
All users must sign up and choose a plan to access the dashboard and core features.

## MVP: Core Features
1. **Podcast Playback**: Listen to full podcast episodes with standard audio controls (play, pause, skip, speed).
2. **AI-Generated Summaries & Takeaways**: Instantly get concise, accurate written summaries and key takeaways for any episode.

### Bonus MVP Feature (if feasible)
- **Notion Integration**: Export summaries and takeaways to Notion for easy reference and productivity.

*AI chat assistant and advanced features are planned, but the absolute MVP is playback + AI summaries/takeaways, with Notion export as a strong candidate for MVP if time allows.*
