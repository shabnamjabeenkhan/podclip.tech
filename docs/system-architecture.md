## Summary
- **Frontend:** React Router v7 app deployed on Vercel (SSR for SEO/performance)
- **Backend:** Convex handles all data, business logic, and API integrations
- **Authentication:** Clerk for user sign-up/login, integrated with frontend and Convex
- **Payments:** Polar.sh for monthly/lifetime plans; webhooks update user access in Convex
- **Email:** Resend for transactional emails triggered by Convex
- **AI:** OpenAI API (or alternative) called by Convex for summaries/takeaways
- **Podcast Data:** Listen Notes API called by Convex, results cached in DB
- **(Bonus) Notion:** Convex sends summaries/takeaways to Notion API for export
- **Data Flow:** All user actions (search, playback, summary generation, export) flow through Convex, which orchestrates external API calls and updates the DB
